# Arjun's First CS193 Homework

Bulleted list of my favorite things about cs193

- The C. C is a very good letter and i am excited to see it in CS193
- The S. Some say that S is the 19th letter in the english alphabet. there is no way to know for sure.
- The 1. 1 is the lonliest number that you'll ever do
- The 9. 9 is not a lonely number. 9 has lots of friends and is considered to be very cool.
- The 3. Much like how 6 is the number of the beast, 3 is the number of the arjun. which is me. i am the arjun.
